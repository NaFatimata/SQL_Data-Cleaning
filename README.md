# SQL_Data-Cleaning

Dataset Used:
[Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx](https://github.com/NaFatimata/SQL_Data-Cleaning/files/7524346/Nashville.Housing.Data.for.Data.Cleaning.xlsx)


In this project, I prepared the Nashville Housing Data for further analysis by removing and modifying incorrect, irrelevant, incomplete, duplicated, or improperly formatted data. This process helps maximize the accuracy of the dataset.
